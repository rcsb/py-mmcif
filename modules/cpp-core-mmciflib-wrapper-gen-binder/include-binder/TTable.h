/**
** \class TTable
**
** \brief Private class that represents a table of tuples.
**
** This class represents a two-dimensional table of cells. Each cell is
** represented by a text string. Tuples are horizontal table entities
** identified by tuple indices, which are unsigned integers ranging from zero
** to the number of tuples minus one. Tuples are vertical table entities
** identified by tuple indices. The class provides methods for table
** construction and destruction, assignment operator, tuple and column based
** methods for addition, insertion, retrieval, update, deletion, cell based
** methods for update and retrieval and table printing.
